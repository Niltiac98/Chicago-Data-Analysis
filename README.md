# Chicago Data Analysis Project

This project is part of the IBM course "SQL: A Practical Introduction for Querying Databases." The objective is to leverage SQL for analyzing socio-economic, crime, and educational data in the City of Chicago. This analysis is aimed at supporting a non-profit organization dedicated to improving socio-economic conditions and educational outcomes for children and youth in Chicago.

## Objectives
Upon completing this project, you will be able to:

- Describe three distinct Chicago datasets.
- Load the datasets into three tables within a Db2 database.
- Write and execute SQL queries to perform exploratory data analysis.
Datasets

## The project utilizes three datasets:

- **Census Data:** Provides demographic information to understand socio-economic conditions.
- **Crime Data:** Offers insights into crime patterns and safety issues.
- **School Data:** Includes details on educational institutions and outcomes.

## Project Tasks
- **Data Loading:** Import the datasets into database tables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Use SQL queries to explore and analyze the data.

## Skills Demonstrated
- SQL query formulation and execution
- Inner and Outer Joins
- Data importation and table creation in Db2
- Analytical thinking and problem-solving using real-world data
